add a config file for the server stuff ip address, hardware types etc

allow for plug and play functions for hardware components. 
ie make getLocation a switch on some global that controls which function is used. so like
getLocation(){
   switch(GPS_TYPE){
      case "BerryGPS":
         BerryGPS_getLocation()
         break
      case "AdaGPS":
         AdaGPS_getLocation()
         break;
      etc.... 
   }
}
